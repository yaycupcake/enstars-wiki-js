# enstars-wiki-js

## Current release version is 1.0.0

Some Javascript for the Ensemble Stars Wiki to make it more responsive and modernized, without having to manually edit hundreds to thousands of pages.

## Features

- Adds toggle to activate theme.
- Adds jump to top button at the bottom of each story page.
- Increases font size, for a more optimal character length for reading.
- Adds the name of the speaking characters, for new fans who may not know who everyone is yet.
- Hides character images on mobile, for a more fluid reading experience.
- Adjusts the background color of the text, and removes borders, for a more modern, cleaner look.

## Known issues and bugs

- In rare instances of multiple speakers (often the twins Hinata and Yuta speaking together), the layout doesn't yet adjust to that.
- For any unknown characters (for example, in collab stories) their name will not display. This leads to an ambiguious speaker on mobile.
- Does not adjust upon window resize -- if you want to switch from "desktop" to "mobile" view or vice versa, a refresh would be required.

## Future plans

*These plans are just that, plans, and are thus not guaranteed to be developed or implemented, and are subject to addition, change, or removal at any time.*

- Separate font size toggle
- Light/dark reader mode toggle
- Option to choose whether to display images or not
- Save the above user preferences to local storage
